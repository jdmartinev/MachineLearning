Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis Challenge**! In this competition, you will develop machine learning models to analyze and predict the sentiment of movie reviews. Your goal is to classify reviews as either *positive* or *negative* based on the text provided.

## Dataset and Task:
- **Training Dataset**: You will be working with the **IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset** (50K labeled reviews). This dataset provides a balanced set of user reviews, with sentiments labeled as either *positive* or *negative*.
- **Test Dataset**: To evaluate the generalization of your models, you will test them on an unseen dataset: the **Rotten Tomatoes Movie Reviews**. This dataset will contain movie reviews from a different source, allowing you to assess how well your model performs on new data.

## Objective:
- Build and train a machine learning model that accurately predicts the sentiment of a movie review.
- Your model will be evaluated based on its performance on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset, where the goal is to achieve the highest accuracy in classifying sentiments correctly.

## Key Points:
- **Input**: Movie review text (free-form text).
- **Output**: A binary sentiment classification: *positive* (1) or *negative* (0).
- **Evaluation Metric**: Model performance will be measured using **accuracy**.

Are you ready to take on the challenge and build a model that can understand movie-goer sentiments across different platforms? Letâ€™s find out!
